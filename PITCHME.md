### Through the CPython Looking Glass

#### `extend` and `+=` on lists

### Setting the stage

```python
def main(config):
    cmd = ["/company/binary"]
    ...
    if config.dryrun:
        cmd += ["--dest", "localhost", "--dryrun"]
```

- “Use extend instead, += is slower and less efficient. This will create new list from originals and concatenate“
- “But += is more pythonic. Doesn’t matter for small lists”
- Good excuse to avoid work!!
